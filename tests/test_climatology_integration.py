"""Integration test for the climatology baseline downscaling method.

Exercises the full ``deepscale.downscale(method="climatology", ...)`` API
against synthetic GCM hindcast + obs data, asserting end-to-end behaviour
that the unit tests in test_methods.py don't cover individually:

- Method is reachable via the high-level API (not just direct import).
- Auto-forecast extraction from the trailing year of ``predictor_hindcast``
  works (mirrors the CV-loop / production calling pattern).
- Output shape is on the obs grid.
- Output equals the obs climatology at every member.
