"""Integration test for the rank-analog downscaling method.

Exercises the full `deepscale.downscale(method="rank-analog", ...)` API
against synthetic GCM hindcast + obs data, asserting end-to-end behavior
that the unit tests in test_methods.py don't cover individually:

- Method is reachable via the high-level API (not just via direct import).
- The auto-forecast extraction from the trailing year of `predictor_hindcast`
  works (mirrors the CV-loop / production calling pattern).
- Output shape is on the obs grid.
- Output values fall in the observed climatology range.
