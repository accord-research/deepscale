"""Significance testing and multiple-comparison control for skill statistics.

Two tools for deciding whether a discovered predictor–predictand relationship is more than the
best of a large search:

* :func:`permutation_test` — is an observed statistic beyond what label-shuffling produces?
* :func:`fdr` — Benjamini–Hochberg control of the false-discovery rate across many tests.

Both are statistic-agnostic. The default statistic is the leave-one-out correlation
(:func:`deepscale.metrics.cross_validation.loo_corr`), which is what makes the permutation test
default to a one-sided upper tail, but any callable ``statistic(x, y) -> float`` can be supplied.

def permutation_test(x, y, *, statistic=loo_corr, alternative="greater", n=5000, rng=None):
    """Permutation p-value for the association between ``x`` and ``y`` under a shuffled null.

    The predictor ``x`` is held fixed and the target ``y`` is shuffled ``n`` times; the p-value is
    the fraction of shuffles whose statistic is at least as extreme as the observed one, with the
    conventional +1 in both numerator and denominator so it is never exactly zero.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : array-like
        Paired predictor and target series.
    statistic : callable, default :func:`~deepscale.metrics.cross_validation.loo_corr`
        ``statistic(x, y) -> float``. Non-finite values from a shuffle are treated as not-extreme.
    alternative : {"greater", "less", "two-sided"}, default "greater"
        ``"greater"`` (upper tail) is correct for a leave-one-out skill statistic, whose null is
        biased negative — a zero-signal predictor yields leave-one-out predictions that
        *anti*-correlate with the target, so a two-sided ``|stat|`` test would be invalid. A
        genuinely predictive ``x``, of either underlying sign, lands in the upper tail.
    n : int, default 5000
        Number of shuffles.
    rng : int | numpy.random.Generator | None
        Seed or generator for reproducibility. A single generator shared across many calls
        preserves one stable draw sequence.

    Returns
    -------
    (observed_statistic, p_value) : tuple of float
        ``p_value`` is NaN when the observed statistic is not finite.
