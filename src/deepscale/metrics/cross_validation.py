"""Closed-form leave-one-out cross-validation for simple linear regression.

For a simple linear regression ``y ~ x`` the leave-one-out prediction of each point has a closed
form through the leverage ``h_i = 1/n + (x_i - x̄)² / Sxx`` (Allen's PRESS identity), so an
n-fold cross-validation costs a single full fit rather than n refits. That makes leave-one-out
skill cheap enough to permute thousands of times — which is exactly what significance testing over
a large predictor search needs (see :mod:`deepscale.metrics.significance`).

These are verification helpers on paired predictor/predictand *series*, not forecast-vs-obs metrics,
so they are plain functions rather than registered :class:`~deepscale.metrics.base.MetricBase`
scores.
