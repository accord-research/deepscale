"""Calibration and uncertainty for scalar forecast series.

Everything else in deepscale calibrates a *field*. But a forecast is often a
single number per year — a Niño3.4 value, a dipole-mode index, a region-averaged
rainfall total — and such a series needs the same two things a field does:
correction against what was observed, and an honest interval around the answer.

* :func:`quantile_map` maps a forecast series onto an observed distribution,
  using the same transfer function as the gridded ``qm`` downscaler
  (:mod:`deepscale.methods._qm_kernel`), so the two cannot disagree.
* :func:`error_bounds` turns a hindcast's realised errors into a confidence
  interval around a new forecast. No distributional assumption is required —
  the historical errors *are* the distribution — though a Gaussian fit is
  available when the sample is small.

Neither function knows what the series measures. A forecast index, a
station-mean rainfall total, and a basin-mean SST are all just series.

    The canonical use is bias-correcting a forecast index against observations:
    ``source`` is the model's hindcast series, ``target`` the observed series
    over the same (or a chosen baseline) period, and ``x`` the new forecast.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : scalar, array or xr.DataArray
        The value(s) to map. A DataArray's dims and coords are preserved.
    source, target : array-like
        Reference samples. They need not be the same length — each is reduced to
        its own empirical CDF first. Non-finite entries are dropped.
    variant : {"empirical", "parametric"}
        ``"empirical"`` matches the sample CDFs directly. ``"parametric"``
        matches Gaussian fits, which is more stable on short records but
        assumes symmetry.
    extrapolate : {"clamp", "linear"}
        What to do with an ``x`` outside ``source``'s range. ``"clamp"`` returns
        the nearest value in ``target`` — safe, but it will silently truncate a
        forecast of a record-breaking event down to the strongest event in the
        training record. ``"linear"`` continues the transfer function's end
        slope. Ignored by the parametric variant, which extrapolates by
        construction.

    Returns
    -------
    Same type as ``x``.

    The error sample is ``hindcast_prediction - hindcast_obs``. Because a value
    that was observed is ``prediction - error``, the interval around a new
    forecast is the forecast minus the error distribution's tail quantiles —
    which also removes any mean bias the model carries, for free.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hindcast_prediction, hindcast_obs : xr.DataArray
        Paired over ``dim``. Any other dims broadcast, so a gridded or
        multi-model interval falls out of the same call.
    forecast : scalar or xr.DataArray
        The value to bracket. Must not carry ``dim``.
    level : float
        Central coverage, e.g. ``0.8`` for an 80% interval.
    method : {"empirical", "gaussian"}
        ``"empirical"`` reads the tail quantiles straight off the error sample
        and assumes nothing about its shape, but cannot resolve a tail finer
        than ``1 / n``. ``"gaussian"`` fits a normal to the errors, which
        extrapolates into the tails at the cost of assuming symmetry.
