"""Calendar utilities for sub-monthly climate time axes.

Two things live here.

**Dekad/pentad arithmetic.** A dekad is a 10-day calendar slice (day 1-10,
11-20, 21-end-of-month), so the third dekad of a month is 8-11 days long. A
pentad is a fixed 5-day slice. Both are identified by their start date. This
logic was previously stranded in ``scripts/s2s/dekads.py``; it is library
behaviour, not script behaviour, so it lives here and the script imports it.

**Season-step alignment.** Splicing one year's partial season onto another
year's remainder (see :mod:`deepscale.completion`) cannot be done on calendar
timestamps: 1997-08-01 is not 2026-08-01, and a leap year shifts every
subsequent day-of-year. What the two years *share* is an ordinal position
within the season -- the k-th dekad of Kiremt, the k-th day of a monsoon.
:func:`season_step` assigns that ordinal, and it is the coordinate every
cross-year alignment in deepscale joins on.

The step index is derived from the time coordinate itself rather than assumed,
so a season sampled dekadally gets dekad steps, one sampled daily gets day
steps, and neither the caller nor the completion engine needs to know which.
